                <h1>JOEY TRIBBIAN</h1>
                <p>Joey comes from an Italian-American family of eight children, of which he is the only son. He is
                    from, and presumably born in, Queens.
                    His grandmother affectionately calls him, "my big fat Joey" telling the gang he weighed twenty-seven
                    pounds at birth. Later Monica's Thanksgiving turkey is about nineteen pounds which Joey tells
                    Rachel, "It's like me when I was born."
                    <br><br>
                    1. Joey: “If he doesn’t like you, this is all a moo point.”
                    <br>
                    Rachel: “A moo point?” Joey: “Yeah. It’s like a cow’s opinion. It just doesn’t matter. It’s moo.”
                    <br>
                    2. “Well, the fridge broke, so I had to eat everything.”
                    <br>
                    3. “These are just feelings. They’ll go away.”
                    <br>
                    4. “Over the line? You’re so far past the line that you can’t even see the line! The line is a dot
                    to you!”
                    <br>
                    5. “You can’t just give up! Is that what a dinosaur would do?”
                    <br>
                    6. “I like it. What’s not to like? Custard? Good. Jam? Good. Meat? Good.”
<br>
7. “Here come the meat sweats.”
<br>
8. “Look at me! I’m Chandler! Could I be wearing any more clothes?”
<br>
9. “That’s right, I stepped up! She’s my friend and she needed help. If I had to, I’d pee on any one of you!”
<br>
10. Joey: “Come on, Chandler. I want this part so much. Just one kiss. I won’t tell anyone.”
<br>
Chandler: “Joey, no means no!”
